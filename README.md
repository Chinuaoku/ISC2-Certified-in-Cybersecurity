# ISC2-Certified-in-Cybersecurity
This is a cybersecurity certification that proves that an individual have the fundamental knowledge, skills and ability  for an entry-level or junior-level cybersecurity role.
It is ANAB accredited, ISO/IEC STANDARD 17024.

This training was originally designed to span a maximum of 180 days, but I completed it much more quickly. I adhered to the schedule and prepared for the Pearson Vue examination. On the day of the test, I followed all the rules and successfully passed the examination. My exam materials underwent further scrutiny in a forensic examination to ensure adherence to best practices, and I passed this evaluation as well. Subsequently, I was afforded the opportunity to embrace the ISC2 code of ethics, which now serves as a guiding principle throughout my journey as a cybersecurity expert. I wholeheartedly accepted this commitment.

I paid my Annual Maintenance fee and maintained my membership with ISC in good standing. Additionally, I have actively pursued opportunities for continuing education on the same ISC2 platform to keep my knowledge up-to-date. My aspiration is to acquire further qualifications, reinforcing my dedication to the cybersecurity industry.
